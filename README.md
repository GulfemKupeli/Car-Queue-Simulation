# Car-Queue-Simulation
Queue Implementation Based Parking Simulation
The main goal of the project is to simulate a parking lot exit queue using a FIFO(first in first out) queue and priority queue. We have N cars exiting a parking lot, each car has a random process completion time and random process time(between 10 and 300 seconds). 
     The project compares the average transaction completion time for each queue type and calcu≈üates the gain.
